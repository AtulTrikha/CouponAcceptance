# CouponAcceptance
This project aims to analyze the data collected from an Amazon Mechanical Turk survey. Various driving scenarios are described in the survey, including the destination, current time, weather, and passengers. Using Data science techniques and visualizations we need to determine whether a customer accepted the driving coupon or not.
